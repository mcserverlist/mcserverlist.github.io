# Minecraft Servers List - Lite Version

Hello everyone! I've created this lite version of the [Minecraft Servers List](http://bit.ly/minecraft-servers-list) Script that doesn't require a lot of server power and also it is easy to maintain. 

**This code is free for everybody to use for personal purposes. It is strictly prohibited to resell any part of the code.**

## How to install
1. Open your FTP and connect to your server
2. Upload the scripts content
3. Make sure you uploaded the .htaccess file
4. Edit the core/database/connect.php file by adding your database details
5. Import the *dump.sql* file to your database that you just added in the connect.php file
6. Edit the *settings* table -> *url* column and put your website installation link ( example: https://myservers.com/ ) ( make sure it has a "/" at the end )

You can now login with your admin account( Username: admin ; Password: admin ) by accessing the ** /login ** url.
